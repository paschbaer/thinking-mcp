# Remaining Work Plan — Thinking-MCP

> Tracked follow-ups. Every unresolved review finding (any severity) must be
> persisted here AND in `activeContext.md` before a scope is closed
> (AGENTS.md → Findings Lifecycle Rule).
>
> Entry format:
> `[ID] severity | finding | trigger point | status (action required / accepted with rationale)`

## Tracked Follow-ups

- [RB-1] LOW | `server-stochasticthinking` is a skeleton (`src/index.ts` only),
  no tests, no parity with clear-thought patterns | trigger: any work on the
  stochastic server | action required: define scope before implementing.
- [RB-2] LOW | `AGENTS.md` root file mixes hand-written project rules and the
  generated guide; regeneration via `agents_guide` merge mode must be used to
  avoid losing hand-written sections | trigger: any template change in
  `src/tools/agents-guide-template.ts` | action required: regenerate via
  merge mode, never overwrite manually.
