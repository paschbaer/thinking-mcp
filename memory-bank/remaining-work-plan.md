# Remaining Work Plan — Thinking-MCP

> Tracked follow-ups. Every unresolved review finding (any severity) must be
> persisted here AND in `activeContext.md` before a scope is closed
> (AGENTS.md → Findings Lifecycle Rule).
>
> Entry format:
> `[ID] severity | finding | trigger point | status (action required / accepted with rationale)`

## Tracked Follow-ups

- [RB-2] LOW | `AGENTS.md` root file mixes hand-written project rules and the
  generated guide; regeneration via `agents_guide` merge mode must be used to
  avoid losing hand-written sections | trigger: any template change in
  `src/tools/agents-guide-template.ts` | action required: regenerate via
  merge mode, never overwrite manually.
- [RB-3] MED | GitNexus-generated "Index stale?" hint inside the
  `<!-- gitnexus:start/end -->` block of AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md recommends
  `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` WITHOUT `--no-stats`; an agent following it
  verbatim reintroduces volatile counts (post-commit review 0441c70,
  pre-existing/tool-generated). Mitigated by the Architecture Map mandate +
  lessonsLearned entry. | trigger: any future `gitnexus analyze` run or GitNexus
  CLI upgrade | accepted observation with mitigation; optional hardening:
  wrapper in `.gitnexus/run.cjs` that injects `--no-stats`, or upstream
  flag support.
- [RB-4] MED | Docker build/run of the new stochastic HTTP image not yet
  executed (docker daemon unavailable in the WSL session; `sudo` required,
  interactive password). Image recipe is 1:1 from the working clear-thought
  image incl. `ENV PORT=3000` + newly generated `package-lock.json` for
  `npm ci`. | trigger: next session with a running docker daemon
  (`sudo service docker start` or Docker Desktop) | action required:
  `docker build -t paschbaer/stochasticthinking servers/server-stochasticthinking`
  then run with `-p 3001:3000` and poll `http://localhost:3001/health`.

## Resolved / Reclassified

- [RB-1] RESOLVED 2026-09-11 | stochastic server was a skeleton (`src/index.ts`
  only, no tests, no HTTP) | fixed by the HTTP-MCP rebuild on
  `feature/stochastic-http-mcp` (phases 0–5): factory + zod config, stdio dev
  entry, Streamable HTTP server with /health, vitest suite (15 tests), live
  funktionstest (6 checks), Docker recipe ported from clear-thought.
