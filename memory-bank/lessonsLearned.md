# Lessons Learned — Thinking-MCP

## Avoid These Mistakes

- **Tool output > 2000 chars per line:** `read_file` truncates single long
  lines (e.g. JSON payloads with a `content` string). Terminal captures hard-
  wrap long lines and corrupt them (mid-word breaks). → Extract structured
  payload with a small script writing directly to the target file, then verify
  with `read_file`; disclose any artifact.
- **Memory/log files must never lose history:** when editing append-only files,
  never use an existing entry's full text as `oldString` with a replacement
  that omits it. Append after a unique tail anchor or include the original
  entry verbatim in the replacement.

## Resolved Decisions & Best Practices

- Guide content lives in `AGENTS_TEMPLATE` + `AGENTS.template.md`; the root
  `AGENTS.md` is generated. All three must stay in sync —
  `tests/agents-guide.test.ts` enforces the contract.
- New reasoning tools: register in `src/tools/index.ts` AND route into the
  matching toolset in `src/toolsets/` — otherwise toolset calls break silently.
