## Avoid These Mistakes

- **Direct module calls bypass zod defaults → NaN payloads:** calling the
  algorithm modules with raw objects (instead of `schema.parse(...)`) leaves
  defaulted fields (`stepReward`, `lengthscale`, `maxIterations`, …) as
  `undefined`; computations silently produce NaN and `JSON.stringify` renders
  them as `null`s — integration tests via the MCP client stayed green while 4
  unit tests failed. → Unit tests must parse params through the zod schemas
  (single source of truth), exactly like the dispatcher does. Found in the
  Real Computing round (2026-09-13).
- **Escaped JSON inside MCP SSE responses:** `tools/call` results arrive as
  `data: {...}` lines where `result.content[0].text` is itself a JSON
  *string* — the inner quotes are escaped (`\"mode\": ...`), so grep patterns
  like `'"mode": "full"'` silently match nothing. → Parse with a real JSON
  pipeline (node `fetch` + `JSON.parse`), never grep raw SSE for inner fields.
- **WSL2 /mnt/c cold-start I/O hang:** Node processes started from this repo
  on `/mnt/c` occasionally hang uninterruptibly during module load (`ps` STAT
  `Dl`): silent, no output, HTTP listener never binds. Environment issue (9P
  filesystem), not a code bug — non-deterministic, retries succeed.
  → For smoke tests, poll the listener instead of using fixed sleeps:
  `until curl -s --max-time 2 http://localhost:PORT/health; do sleep 1; done`.
  Discovered in the stochastic HTTP-MCP phase 3 verification (2026-09-11).
- **MCP stdio smoke tests need open stdin (SDK 1.30):** With immediately-closed
  stdin (`/dev/null` or `printf … | node dist/index.js` without a trailing
  `sleep`), the server under `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30 starts silently
  (no startup line, no responses, process lingers until killed) — looks like a
  broken build. → Hold stdin open like a real client:
  `(sleep 1; printf '%s\n' '<requests>'; sleep 3) | node dist/index.js`.
  Discovered in the stochastic HTTP-MCP Phase-0 spike (2026-09-11).
- **Tool output > 2000 chars per line:** `read_file` truncates single long
  lines (e.g. JSON payloads with a `content` string). Terminal captures hard-
  wrap long lines and corrupt them (mid-word breaks). → Extract structured
  payload with a small script writing directly to the target file, then verify
  with `read_file`; disclose any artifact.
- **Memory/log files must never lose history:** when editing append-only files,
  never use an existing entry's full text as `oldString` with a replacement
  that omits it. Append after a unique tail anchor or include the original
  entry verbatim in the replacement.

## Resolved Decisions & Best Practices

- **GitNexus stats pollute rule files:** plain `gitnexus analyze` rewrites the
  GitNexus block in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md with volatile counts (symbols,
  relationships, flows) on every run, dirtying committed rule files.
  → Always run `gitnexus analyze --no-stats` in this repo; never hand-edit
  content inside the generated block (it is rewritten anyway).
- Guide content lives in `AGENTS_TEMPLATE` + `AGENTS.template.md`; the root
  `AGENTS.md` is generated. All three must stay in sync —
  `tests/agents-guide.test.ts` enforces the contract.
- New reasoning tools: register in `src/tools/index.ts` AND route into the
  matching toolset in `src/toolsets/` — otherwise toolset calls break silently.
- **Tool-metadata strategy (decision 2026-09-13):** for productive (typed)
  outputSchemas + human-readable titles (RB-10), use a central metadata
  registry (`src/tools/tool-metadata.ts`) applied by the existing central
  `tool.update()` loop in `src/index.ts` — decisionframework
  `rb10-schema-strategy-2026-09-13` — instead of editing ~25 register files
  or keeping passthrough-only schemas. Plan: `plans/quality-distribution.md`.
